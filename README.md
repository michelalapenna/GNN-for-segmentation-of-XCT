# Geometric Deep Learning for enhanced quantitative analysis of Microstructures in X-ray Computed Tomography Data

Quantitative microstructural analysis of XCT 3D images is
key for quality assurance of materials and components. In this paper we
implement a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) architecture
to segment a complex Alâ€“Si Metal Matrix composite XCT volume (3D
image). We train the model on a synthetic dataset and we assess its
performance on both synthetic and experimental, manually labelled,
datasets. Our simple GCNN shows a comparable performance to more
standard machine learning methods, but uses a greatly reduced number
of parameters, features low training time, and needs little hardware
resources. Our GCNN thus achieves a cost-effective reliable segmentation.
